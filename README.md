### Course Description
This course is intended to teach first and second-year students common computer science practices which are normally accrued after taking higher-level coding classes, engaging with lots of coding projects, and working at established software engineering companies. The primary goal is to make students feel comfortable tackling large projects because by the end of the semester, they’ll have similar insights as someone with more experience.

We are going to focus primarily on building web applications, but a lot of the concepts we’ll talk about can apply to building any kind of project. We’ll delve into things like getting the most out of Git, using package managers, following accepted industry practices, developing robust APIs, using the shell effectively, designing an app’s frontend, and general project deployment, scaling, and management.

This class is very heavily lecture-based. We expect students to come to every class. Additionally, we will have a demo project that is synced with our lectures (and make public all its source code). Although it’s not required, we encourage students to either follow along with this demo project or build a unique project themselves (individually or with a team) as we discuss the relevant concepts in class. We might have small reading assignments or tasks throughout the semester.

### Prerequisites
CS 1110 or equivalent (or instructor permission).

### Instructors
Srikanth Chelluri (B.S. Computer Engineering, Engineering Business Minor),
[sc5ba@virginia.edu](mailto:sc5ba@virginia.edu),
graduating December 2017

Nikhil Gupta (B.S. Computer Science, Engineering Business Minor),
[ng3br@virginia.edu](mailto:ng3br@virginia.edu),
graduating May 2018

We’ve taken several courses in the computer science department; interned at a few different software engineering companies; and built and currently manage a course organization tool for students at the University:  [www.uvaschedule.me](www.uvaschedule.me).

### Faculty advisor
Professor Tom Pinckney,

### Textbooks
None. If reading is required, it'll be availabile online and we'll provide the link.

### Grading policies
Class attendance is 10 points per lecture.
Small homework assignments will be worth a variable number of points, from 0 up to 10.

There should be an excess of 120 points over the course of the semester. Getting above a 75% of however many points there are entails a passing grade.

**Week 1**: We’ll provide a brief introduction of the course, then delve into version control - primarily focusing on Git. We’ll learn about the network/graph nature of version control and how to do lots more than just pushing new changes. We’ll also discuss general coding workflow (ticket tracking, online tools like StackOverflow, and how it works in industries and with teams).

**Week 2**: We’ll talk about web languages as a whole. We’ll understand how different languages are used for different purposes and how they complement each other.

**Week 3**: We’ll talk about project frameworks and package managers to simplify and organize workflow. This is when students pick a project or decide to follow along with the demo project.

**Week 4**: We’ll discuss the common model-view-controller (MVC) architecture. Students will learn what it is, how it works, and why it is such a ubiquitous architecture in the real world. We’ll focus on Django’s implementation of this, as many higher-level classes use Django.

**Week 5**: We’ll talk about the importance of frontend design. We’ll discuss commonly agreed-upon principles of today, as well as the frameworks and tools that are out there to help frontend work easier.

**Week 6**: We’ll talk about testing. We’ll discuss why it’s important, how to write good tests, and what industry is doing now. We’ll discuss continuous integration this week as well.

**Week 7**: This lecture will be focused on the basic relational database structure. We’ll talk about the difference between NoSQL and SQL, and other common database topics.

**Week 8**: We’ll discuss what APIs are and the excitement around RESTful APIs. We’ll share good practices and the tools that are out there when developing APIs.

**Week 9**: We will discuss the abstraction layers of creating an application - particularly a web one. We’ll talk about communication between an application and its data, communication from outside hosts to the application, and then go down the network layers - reliable transport and the protocols associated with them.

**Week 10**: We are going to discuss deploying your application to the world. We’ll talk about the services out there (PaaS) and we’ll briefly discuss security, staging branches, and general management when it’s live. We will also talk about scaling the application based on load.

**Week 11**: We’ll use this lecture to talk about industry practices we’ve learned. We’ll discuss how features moves from mere ideas to actual users’ screens. We’ll discuss team structure, alpha/beta testing, and more.

**Week 12**: This class will be decided based on what students think is most important. We’ll take a poll to see which topic is of most interest to the class as a whole.
